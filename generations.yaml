generations:
  - name: "First Generation (Y1)"
    start_year: 1985

    description: "The original Hyundai Sonata was a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive sedan based on the Hyundai Stellar but with updated styling. Available primarily in South Korea and limited export markets, it featured a conservative design typical of midsize sedans of its era. Powered by a range of four-cylinder engines with modest performance, it positioned itself as an affordable alternative to established competitors. The interior was basic but functional, with a focus on durability rather than luxury. This generation established the Sonata nameplate that would eventually become one of Hyundai's global core models, though it was still early in the company's development as an automaker."

Now using front-wheel drive architecture, it featured more modern styling influenced by European design trends. Available with a range of four-cylinder and V6 engines, it offered improved performance and refinement over its predecessor. The interior saw enhancements in design and materials, though still positioned as a value-oriented option. This generation began Hyundai's expansion into more international markets, including North America, though the company still struggled with quality perception compared to Japanese competitors."

The interior received significant improvements in design, materials, and features, reflecting Hyundai's efforts to move upmarket. This generation was also produced as the Hyundai Marcia between 1995 and 1998 in South Korea only, featuring restyled front and rear fascias. This generation represented an important step forward in Hyundai's global competitiveness, though the company was still establishing its reputation for quality and reliability in many markets."

Built on Hyundai's latest N3 platform architecture with the 'Sensuous Sportiness' design language, it offers improved dynamics, refinement, and safety. Despite being classified as mid-size in North America, its cabin volume places it in the EPA's full-size classification.

A new curved display combines two separate displays under a single pane of glass, and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are now expanded to all models. The N Line variant continues with a turbocharged 2.5-liter engine producing 290 horsepower and paired with an eight-speed wet dual-clutch transmission. Despite its impressive features and design, this generation faces challenges as consumer preferences continue to shift away from sedans toward SUVs and crossovers."
